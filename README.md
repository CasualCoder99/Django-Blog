# Django Blog Application

This project was created as an introduction to web development using Django and basic HTML and CSS for frontend work.

This web application allows users with the CRUD functionality for blogs. A guest user can view all the blogs written by all other users. When a registered user logs in the app, he or she will now have the ability to create new blogs and edit and even delete the blogs they have already made.
